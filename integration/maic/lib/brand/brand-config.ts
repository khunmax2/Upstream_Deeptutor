/**
 * Brand configuration.

 * One source of truth for the product name and logo, read by every surface
 * that shows either: the home hero, the classroom sidebar, the workspace rail
 * and home, the slide editor rail, the access-code gate and the page title.
 *
 * The shape is the reference's, which resolved a brand per vendor from a
 * desktop shell's User-Agent token. This deployment has no vendor shell, so the
 * values are static — but they are read from the environment first, so the
 * product can be re-branded without touching source. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is inlined
 * by Next at build time, so changing one of these needs a rebuild, not a
 * restart.
